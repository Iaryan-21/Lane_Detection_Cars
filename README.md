# Lane Detection for Vehicles

This project is dedicated to the development of an advanced lane detection system for vehicles, utilizing computer vision techniques with OpenCV. The focus is on enhancing the accuracy of lane detection on freeways by employing two main strategies:

## Hough Transform for Line Detection

Implemented the Hough Transform algorithm to identify and delineate the distinct lines of lanes on a freeway. This technique allows us to map out lane lines with precision, forming the backbone of the lane detection system.

## Canny Edge Detection

To further refine our detection system, applied the Canny Edge Detection method. This approach enables us to accurately locate the boundaries of lanes on a freeway, which is a critical component for ensuring reliable lane tracking and vehicle navigation.

## Test Video

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our lane detection system,  included a test video. Due to file size limitations, the video is hosted externally. Please download the video from the following link and ensure the correct path is set before running the code.
